This project explores how machine learning can be used to price European options and compares its performance with classical analytical and numerical approaches (Black–Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations). Using either simulated or real market data, I want to create a dataset of option prices based on key inputs such as the underlying asset price, strike, time to maturity, interest rate, and volatility.
The underlying assets considered will include highly traded instruments such as the S&P 500 index (SPX) or large-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), which offer rich and reliable option data.
Different machine learning models such as linear regression, tree-based methods or neural networks (need to find out the best model) will be trained to approximate the option pricing function. Their predictions will then be compared to theoretical Black–Scholes values and Monte Carlo estimates, evaluating both accuracy (MAE, RMSE) and computational efficiency.
The goal is to see whether data-driven models can match or even outperform traditional methods in terms of speed or adaptability, especially under more complex market conditions. The project combines financial theory with modern data science techniques, illustrating how machine learning can serve as a flexible and powerful tool for option valuation.
